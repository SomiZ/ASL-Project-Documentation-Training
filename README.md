# AbiliTech ASL Project: Documentation & Training Resources

**Role:** Data Analyst Intern | **Focus:** Technical Documentation, Data Validation, & Team Training

## 📂 Project Overview
This repository showcases the technical documentation and educational materials I developed for the **AbiliTech ASL Translation Project**. My primary goal was to bridge the gap between technical LLM outputs and human annotators by standardizing workflows and creating a comprehensive knowledge base.

## 📄 Technical Documentation
*The following documents were created to define grammar rules and validation protocols:*
- **[Full Technical Documentation & Evaluation](./Full_Technical_Documentation_And_Evaluation.pdf):** A merged document containing the ASL architecture guide, validation plan, and model evaluation reports.

## 🎥 Training Video Tutorials
I produced 8 video tutorials to train the team on the annotation platform and ASL linguistics.
